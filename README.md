# Possible outcomes of flipping _n_ coins

In one of my programming classes the instructor asked if we can make a program that takes an input and print all possible of coins for example:

```javascript
node . --coins=2
```

should print: 

```javascript
[ 'hhtt', 'hhth', 'hhhh', 'tthh' ]
```
## Spoiler
>! basically it was just a small test amongst other students if anyone were able to do the task, pretty much no one were able to ( not to brag ). it was a class of like 15 students of which only 2-3 were interested in class.

## Complexities

it was just an institute ( not an university ) where they gave out diplomas for completing 3 years there. pretty much every student were a beginner and didn't hold any knowledge for time and space complexities so on, because we were taught the basics pretty much.

i will probably make this code be more optimized for much higher count at some point and compare my old hack-y approach for this problem, though the instructor said he would be happy if we can print outcomes for atleast 8 coins mine was able to go till 15, at 16 it runs out of memory and crashed. :kekw:
